TYPES OF DATABASES:

RDMS (SQL)                              |   Non-RDMS (noSQL)                                       |
* Organize data into 1 or more tables   | *Oraganize data is anything but not traditional table
    # Each table - columns & rows       |      # Key value stores
    # A unique key identifies each row  |      # Docs like JSON, XML etc
        Example: Excel spreadsheet      |         # Graphs, Flexible tables
                                        |
* mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB etc|  * mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc 

 SQL - To define tables and structures
   Disadv... SQL used on one RDMS can't be portable without modification
noSQL - Implement their iwn lang for performing CRUD & admin operations on database
 


Database Queries - Ex: Google search

  - Requests made to DBMS for specific info
  - DB structure complex ‚àù Difficulty level of getting info

Primary key/Natural key - Has mapping to real word like Aadhar or Security number     

Surrogate key - Has no mapping to real world (just random numbers or names)
              * Can also be used as primary key

Foreign key   - used to link one DB table to other
               * stores primary key of a row in another DB table
               * This will actually acts as primary key inside other table (Branch table)

 Composite key - It has 2 or more foreign keys
